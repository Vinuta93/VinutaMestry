							<b>Image 1 – The Egg.</b>
							Concept:-
							The egg, ancient symbol of a new life because it encloses nascent life to emerge from it. It embodies the idea of rebirth, warmth, protection, and rejuvenation in the cycle of life. It represents how an adolescent needs protection yet at the same time, needs to break the shell by himself/herself in order to begin their journey as an independent human.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Image 2 – Fire.</b>
	  					Concept:-
							Fire, along with Water, Air, and Earth, is one of the most important elements of life. Fire, a symbol of strength, can be perceived in multiple ways. It can be perceived as a danger or even a ray of hope. When everything around us is imperceivable, fire can make it foreseeable.  Fire can impart how dedication and determination in life can take one places. However, it can also be perceived as a sign of revenge. The meaning lies in the mind of the beholder.
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>Image 3 – Tree</b>
							Concept:-
							Tree: It is a symbol of life and wisdom. Roots of the Tree are earthed, and the branches are flying in the sky. It teaches humility, dreaming and perseverance. If we can be as humble as the roots of the tree, a dream to fly as the branches of the trees, protect the people in our vicinity from the scorching heat of depression, and be a hospital to strangers then surely we can be an epitome of an ideal human being to the human race.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Image 4 – Mask</b>
							Concept:-
							Mask has become today's necessity. I always related mask to two-faced people, however, the ongoing pandemic has compelled me to perceive it as a symbol of safeguard for life. It has taught me that by protecting others we can protect us and vice-versa. Thus it imparts the quality such as kindness and selflessness in Life.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Image 5 – Trap (Web of Life) </b>
							Concept
							Since childhood as we grow up, we keep expanding and adding new layers to our lifestyle. We entangle ourself with numerous layers and strands of lifestyle, our job, family, emotional aspects, financial issues.
							Like a spider spins the web and in the end mostly dies by getting stuck in his own web, similar is the story of our lifestyle as well. We keep adding layers and spinning a web of career, financial aspects, emotional imbalances, immediate families etc. around us and later get so entangled and trapped in our own routine that it becomes unable to escape from this trap.
